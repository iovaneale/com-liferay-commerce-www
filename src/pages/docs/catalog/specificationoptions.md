## <h5>Define Virtual Product characteristics</h5>

Differently from a Simple Product creation, at this point the "Virtual" tab appears to let the SM define the options that characterize a Virtual Product.

<b>Virtual</b><br>

- <b>URL or file selection</b>

	Since, as said, Virtual Products are downloadable, the first thing we need is the location where the file is stored to. This location could be an URL, otherwise the SM can upload it making it available for download.

- <b>Base informations</b>

	The second step is to insert the properties of the virtual product to sell (not the file).
	The SM can set:

	- Activation Status (future feature)
		this option will give the capability to decide when the product will be available to the customer (e.g. paid, ordered, etc.)

	- Duration
		this feature allows the SM to set the number of the days during which customers keep acces to the file. The default value is 0 that means unlimited downloads

	- Max Usage
		similar to "Duration" through this option the SM can set the maximum number of download expressed in times.

- <b>Sample</b>

	The SM can upload a file (or set the URL where the file will be downloaded from) to use as example of the Virtual Product (e.g. trials, demos. etc.). The file will be used only if the special checkbox "Use Sample" is checked.

- <b>Terms of Use</b>

	Through this section is possible, by checking the special checkbox, to write the terms and condition required for the usage of the product, or to uploaad a pre-written file. The file, or the text, will be used only if the special checkbox "Terms of Use" is checked.
