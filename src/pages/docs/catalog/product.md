## <h5>Define product's basic informations</h5>

To complete the simple product creation process, fill the form inserting the basic informations that characterize the product.

<u><b>Required</b></u>:

1. <b>Title</b><br><br>
	The product information shown in the products list.

<u><b>Optional</b></u>:

1. <b>Friendy URL</b><br>
	An URL that provides a direct access to the product on a certain site page. It's a localized URL that can be translated into how many languages wanted among those available.

2. <b>Short Description</b><br>
	A brief product text description about product's basic features.

3. <b>Full Description</b><br>
	Differently form the Short Description, the Full Description field gives to the store manager the chance to add a cuter and more ditailed presentation of the product making text bold, uderlined, italic or adding a picture within it. Furthermore the store manager has the possibility to add all the features provided by html by using the integrated html editor.

4. <b>Base SKU</b><br>
	One of the most important features of a product to pay attention to, is the Stocking Keeping Unit.
	SKU is an univocal code that identifies our product to sell that includes all the informations about the attributes of a product.

	The Base SKU is a code that SM can associate to the product for his convenience that, if a more complex and complete SKU will be added, will act as prefix of the latter.

5. <b>Product Display Page</b><br>
	Through this function, SM has the chanche to choose the page within the site in which the prouct must be published in.

	<u><b>N.B. THIS FEATURE NEEDS A FRIENDLY URL TO BE SET</b></u>.

6. <b>Published</b><br>
	...

7. <b>Display Date</b><br>
	SM has the choose the Date and Time of a product to be published. Until that date, its status will be "Scheduled".

8. <b>Expiration Date</b><br>
	Likewise Display Date, SM could choose Date and Time of a product to expire. After that date, its status will be "Expired". This option can be activated unchecking "Never Expire".

## <h5>Publish or Save as Draft</h5>

<h6>Once all the essential information that a product need to exist have been inserted, so the SM has the possibility to choose to publish the product, or save it as a draft to be afterwards published or deleted.</h6>

1. <b>Publish</b><br>
	Clicking on Publish allows the SM to continue the process of creating a product by inserting additional informations to it.

2. <b>Save as Draft</b><br>
	Clicking on Save as Draft, the SM will be redirected to the Catalog. As the SM may notice, the status of the product we created is set as "Draft".

</article>

<article id="4"><br>


## <h5>Add additional informations</h5>

- <b>Images</b><br>
	The SM has the capability to associate as many images that he wants to give the product a further information as well as a better visual impact in the Catalog. Images can be selected from the existing library, or uploaded on-the-fly. Only image files are allowed to be attached through this section.

	<img class="docs-img" src="/images/Images.png"/>

	<img class="docs-img" src="/images/Images2.png"/>

	<img class="docs-img" src="/images/Images3.png"/>

	<div class="container-fluid" style="padding: 30px 0px">
		<span><img class="col-md-6" style="width: 50%; padding: 5px" src="/images/Images4.png"/></span>
		<span><img class="col-md-6" style="width: 50%; padding: 5px" src="/images/Images5.png"/></span>
	</div>

- <b>Options</b><br>
	This is, probabily, one of the most important feature of a product creation process. Here has given the SM the capability to add an attribute that will give to the product an univocal characteristic that will turn it from a generic item to a specific one, with its own SKU, different from the same product with different attributes.<br><br> (e.g. Think about a t-shirt as the general product. Once the SM associates the color attribute which in turn has "Blue" and "Red" values, the actual sellable item will be a Blue t-shirt and a Red t-shirt.)<br><br> The options can be selected from the previously created ones, or can be created (or edited) on the fly through this section.<br><br> <u><b>N.B. ON THE FLY CREATED OR EDITED OPTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR THE CURRENT PRODUCT</b></u>.

- <b>SKUs</b><br>
	Strictly connected to "Options", this section lets the SM assign to the general product (t-shirt) SKUs that will identify each different attribute-based variant of the same product (Blue t-shirt, Red t-shirt, Black t-shirt). Furthermore, the SM has the capability to automatically generate every possible combination of attribute-based SKU for the product.<br><br> <u><b>N.B. ONLY SKU-CONTRIBUTOR ASSOCIATED OPTIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERATION OF A SKU</b></u>.

	<img class="docs-img" src="/images/SKUs.png"/>

- <b>Attachments</b><br>
	Through this section, differently from Images, the SM can attach to the product any kind of file he needs to. The process is the same of Images.

- <b>Related Products</b><br>
	The last feature present in this process is the capability to select products from the catalog to to be related to the current one, in order to provide, as final result, a suggestion to the customer to visit (and hopefully buy) more products.

## <h5>Product editing</h5>

Once created, product details can be easily edited.

SM can do this in two ways:

-	<b>Via Title</b><br><br>
	It is enough to click on the title of the product you want to edit to enter its details page.

-	<b>Via Ellipsis menu</b><br><br>
	By clicking on the three dots at the end of the product's row, a small menu with two options appears.
<a href="/images/optionEditEllipsis.png">
	<img class="docs-img" src="/images/optionEditEllipsis.png"/>
</a>
	You can:

-	<b>Edit</b><br><br>
		Enter the option's details page.

-	<b>Move to recycle bin</b><br>
	The product is moved to the recycle bin (Content -> Recycle Bin).<br>

	<img class="docs-img" src="/images/recycleBin.png"/>

	From the recycle bin products can be restored or definitively deleted.

Once saved, the old informations are replaced by the new.

## <h5>Product deletion</h5>

Another way to delete a product (or many) from the catalog is by selecting it through checkbox and then clicking on the recycle bin button that appears at the top right corner of the catalog.<br>

SM has also the chance to delete all the products from the catalog checking the "Select All" box and the clicking on the recycle bin button.
